According to NIS Viewer, the XY resolution of our images acquired with the 40x objective is 30 pixels per 10 um, or 0.333... pixels per um. The typical z resolution is 2 um per step, or 2 um per pixel. The ratio between pixel size in Z and in XY is therefore 6, meaning the cellpose anisotropy flag should be set to 6.
