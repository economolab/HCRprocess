"args" is a struct containing all the variables passed from MATLAB to python. It's saved as a json in a specified location that must match between MATLAB and python. 

elastixBspline.py
This script loads the json created in MATLAB and runs "doIntensityBspline." The first thing this function does is load and preprocess the moving and fixed images with "getProcessedImages."
